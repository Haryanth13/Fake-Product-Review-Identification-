# 🛍️ Fake Product Review Identification  

## 📌 Overview  
This project identifies fake product reviews using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning**.  
It classifies reviews as **fake or genuine** to enhance trust in product ratings.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- Detects **fake vs genuine reviews**  
- Uses **sentiment analysis** and **linguistic features**  
- Optimized feature selection reduces processing time by **30%**  
- Improved classification precision by **15%**  
- Includes trained models and evaluation results  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- Python  
- NLTK / spaCy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib

## 📊 Workflow  
1. Data Collection (Amazon/Yelp reviews dataset)  
2. Text Preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)  
3. Feature Extraction (TF-IDF, BoW, sentiment features)  
4. Model Training (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM)  
5. Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score)  
6. Saving trained models and results  

---

## 📈 Results  
- **Precision:** Improved by 15% compared to baseline models  
- **Processing Time:** Reduced by 30% with optimized feature selection  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score available in results/  

---

## 🧠 Models  
- Logistic Regression (`logistic_regression.pkl`)  
- Decision Tree (`decision_tree.pkl`)  
- Support Vector Machine (`svm_model.pkl`)  

Saved models are available in the `models/` folder for reuse and deployment.  

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements  
- Use **Deep Learning (BERT, LSTM)** for more advanced detection  
- Deploy as a **web application** for real-time analysis  
- Expand dataset across multiple domains
