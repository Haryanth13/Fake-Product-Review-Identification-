🛍️ Fake Product Review Identification
📌 Overview
This project identifies fake product reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning.
It classifies reviews as fake or genuine to enhance trust in product ratings.

🚀 Features
Detects fake vs genuine reviews
Uses sentiment analysis and linguistic features
Optimized feature selection reduces processing time by 30%
Improved classification precision by 15%
Includes trained models and evaluation results
🛠️ Tech Stack
Python
NLTK / spaCy
Scikit-learn
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib
📊 Workflow
Data Collection (Amazon/Yelp reviews dataset)
Text Preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)
Feature Extraction (TF-IDF, BoW, sentiment features)
Model Training (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM)
Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
Saving trained models and results
📈 Results
Precision: Improved by 15% compared to baseline models
Processing Time: Reduced by 30% with optimized feature selection
Evaluation Metrics: Confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score available in results/
🧠 Models
Logistic Regression (logistic_regression.pkl)
Decision Tree (decision_tree.pkl)
Support Vector Machine (svm_model.pkl)
Saved models are available in the models/ folder for reuse and deployment.

🔮 Future Improvements
Use Deep Learning (BERT, LSTM) for more advanced detection
Deploy as a web application for real-time analysis
Expand dataset across multiple domains
